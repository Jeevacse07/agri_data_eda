AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture with EDA

Project Overview

India's agricultural sector plays a crucial role in the economy, but managing agricultural data remains a challenge due to its complexity and fragmented nature. This project, AgriData Explorer, focuses on analyzing Indian agricultural data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), SQL integration, and interactive visualizations. The goal is to provide insights into crop production, yields, and farming areas across different states and districts in India.

Key Steps in the Project

Data Collection & Cleaning: Loading data from Excel, renaming columns, removing invalid values, and preparing structured datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover trends and insights.

SQL Integration: Structuring data into MySQL tables and executing SQL queries for deeper insights.

Analytical Solutions: Addressing 10 key agricultural questions using SQL and Python-based analysis.

Visualization & Reporting: Creating interactive charts and Power BI dashboards for intuitive data representation.

This project serves as a data-driven tool for farmers, policymakers, and researchers to make informed decisions regarding agriculture in India.
